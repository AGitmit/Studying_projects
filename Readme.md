# Learning projects

This repo is just some random projects that I've written while learning, implementing stuff, and decided to upload here.  
Don't take it too seriously...  

### Sub-repos
* Py_Usher - This is a small project of a working Python module that turns your programs into an event-driven system that's also implementing concurrency, using multithreading, or parallelism using multiprocessing - this is done by importing the Py-ShiftManager package that I've made.  

* Twitter-clone - This is a Flask framwork project that copies the basic behaviour of Twitter API, written as micro-services, making use of JWT tokens and more.
